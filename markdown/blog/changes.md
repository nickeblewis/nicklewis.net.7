## Finding your direction
This week I am going to "take stock" of where this website is going and to talk about why I am going to rebrand it. In fact you'll notice that it has changed. It has a new title and some new layouts, all of which will be expanded upon in the weeks to come. I have been torn for some time over having a website named after myself rather than the topic it represents, come to think of it, over the years this site has gone through so many changes, it's direction never really settling on one thing. So I decided that had to change, since I want to make a success out of the work that I do.

## Time for a re-brand
So I am going to break the site up into two, keeping nicklewis.net as it was and creating a new site, with new domain called "The Rambling Photographer" which will help me maintain my focus for the rest of Write52 and beyond. So the links I share soon will be on the new domain most of the time...

## Location guides
The new site will focus on providing it's audience with town, city, village and rural guides complete with photos, maps and wot-not. I am also going to host photowalks and workshops etc... So will be very busy soon, doing some location research and so on!

Anyway, there is that going on.

## The Journey
It's interesting how when you start on a journey, you may not necessarily know the end goal or which direction to take and I hope the next few paragraphs of my rambling (see what I did there!) may help other people in some way, that tricky task of knowing your destiny as a content creator.

## Sources of inspiration
In terms of blogging, some of the best examples I've seen online have been those that stick to their guns and I shall throw in a few examples below of bloggers who have inspired me. 

- The Lost Byway
- Baldhiker
- Documentally

This realisation led me to seriously doubt myself and any work that I had written in the past, that I knew I had to take a whole new approach. Write52 came along at the right time, and since getting involved I am really pleased with the response to my most recent articles. A few months ago I registered the domain theramblingphotographer.com and a few days ago I remembered I had created it! It dawned on me that is a great name and fits the subject matter. I love walking, exploring, finding fascinating places and people, all of which leads to the photographs I take. I have always wanted to write a new kind of walking book or series of them, so why not start out with a blog, then some more in-depth guides that I could charge for. I will ultimately look into self-publishing.

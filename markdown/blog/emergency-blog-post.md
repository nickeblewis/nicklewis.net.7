Normally I write about photography and the places that inspire me but this week has been a bit disjointed, so instead I am writing about being a freelancer and how at times you need to cope with weeks where not much happens or you are up-to-date waiting on other people to get their act together! It is odd because I've not had a week like this in a long time, you'd thought I'd be happy but the truth is I am not, for the simple reason I prefer to work with purpose. So this post is all about my contract job and contracting in general for those who may be interested. How do you deal with those peaks and troughs, which can be applied to any form of job really, whether you are a writer, photographer, web developer or whatever you may do.

I have contracted since 2002 and at times have also freelanced. One of the key skills I have had to pretty much conjure up has been the art of managing my time, how to cope when you are flat out is one thing but what do you do when there is nothing, your clients have gone quiet on you or in the case of contracts sometimes you have quiet weeks - does it mean your work is done? Is it time to worry? Should you be circulating your CV? What can you do or what should you be doing?

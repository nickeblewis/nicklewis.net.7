## The Rambling Photographer

(Alternative title for this website...)

I've always liked to share my **travel experiences**. Several years ago I started a blog in my mother language (Portuguese) for my most devoted audience (my family), where I would write about my **life abroad**. It was a success, and it always represented a good reason to document every step of my ways.

I love to combine a number of interests together and to share them through the medium of photography and writing. Subject matters span a broad gamut, ranging from urban travel to nature in miniature. 

CHEAT: Take bio from nicklewis.online that one was pretty neat....


But I've always had the desire to **reach a wider audience**, like-minded folks who are also interested in all of these things. And during my many hours of research for my own trips, I realized there was an abundance of people writing about travel, another multitude writing about architecture, but few putting them **together** to create something useful and inspiring for people like me.

That is the goal of this site: **to join architecture and travel in one place and to transform it into something useful or inspiring for you.** I am not a professional traveler like many out there, I have a day job and counted vacation days every year, but I do try to travel a lot, and I intend to turn each trip into a story worth of your time.

So bear with me, and **subscribe to receive news and notifications.** I promise to keep your privacy at a maximum and the bugging at a minimum:

Also, you can follow **The Foreign Architect** in some social media out there (check links below!). And email me anytime with ideas, suggestions, or just to say hello: **nick@nicklewis.net**.

Newsletters are a great tool for communicating with your audience on a more personal level, what's more your audience can keep copies more easily using good old fashioned email. I love reading them myself and over the years I've been inspired to kick off my very own. You can sign up for it here and at the moment I must confess it is somewhat sporadic but never more frequent than every two weeks.

The best newsletters are those that seem especially curated, containing not only links to the author's latest content but other selected content around the topic. 

**My Newsletter will provide you with the latest content of this site, as well as selected links about photography and outdoor walking.**

Subscribe and receive every so often, how often is a bit hard to say at the moment as I am formulating this thing, it is new to me, so bear with us.

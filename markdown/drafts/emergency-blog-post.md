This week I am going to "take stock" of where this website is going and to talk about why I am going to rebrand it. In fact you'll notice that it has changed. It has a new title and some new layouts, all of which will be expanded upon in the weeks to come. I have been torn for some time over having a website named after myself rather than the topic it represents, come to think of it, over the years this site has gone through so many changes, it's direction never really settling on one thing. So I decided that has to change, because I want to make a success out of the work that I do.

So I am going to break the site up into two, keeping nicklewis.net as it was and creating a new site, with new domain called "The Rambling Photographer" which will help me maintain my focus for the rest of Write52 and beyond. So the links I share soon will be on the new domain most of the time...

The new site will focus on providing it's audience with town, city, village and rural guides complete with photos, maps and wot-not. I am also going to host photowalks and workshops etc...

Anyway, there is that going on.

It's interesting how when you start on a journey, you may not necessarily know the end goal or which direction to take and I hope the next few paragraphs of my rambling (see what I did there!) may help other people in some way, that tricky task of knowing your destiny as a content creator.

In terms of blogging, some of the best examples I've seen online have been those that stick to their guns and I shall throw in a few examples below of bloggers who have inspired me. Apologies if none are Write52 contributors.

This realisation led me to seriously doubt myself and any work that I had written in the past, that I knew I had to take a whole new approach. Write52 came along at the right time, as I am really pleased with the response to my most recent articles. So I want to build on it massively.

summary: Pitching Netlify vs Sanity when using them together
---
One of the advantages of a Jamstack site is that you can pull data in from a variety of sources and not just one, as is the case with some systems. Sure enough Wordpress and Drupal setups don't prevent you from doing this but there is a great deal more work to do. In the case of this Gridsome based website, it is relatively simple to mix things up a little bit. Question is why do this? I can explain the reasons why I do it and perhaps help you get a better idea of how you could, should you choose to do so, follow suit.

This site at the time of writing has two main sections blog and photos, one of which is powered by pure markdown and editable via Netlify CMS and also I can use a desktop based editor to directly work on the markdown files, just like any other code for this website. Then for my photos section that is powered by Sanity.io and offers a slightly different approach to content management but one that is also very customisable. Both approaches have their strengths and pitfalls.

Why do this though? I like to experiment with the different tools available and they all have their merits. To really explain this though, let me run you through my configuration with some screenshots, examples and maybe a brief video or two.

## What are the costs either way?
Netlify and Sanity both cost, at the moment I am paying for netlify and still within my remit for the free tier with Sanity. However at some point when I max this out, I will need to pay for both services. I am wary of this because the costs could mount up but I need both of them or do I? This is why this is a much an experiment as it is a live production site.

## How do Netlify and Sanity compare on mobile?
Sanity wins straight away, there is no contest as Netlify CMS is a bit fiddly on mobile devices, it is responsive but I've had some problems. These niggles are minor though, I can live with them but Sanity just takes it in it's stride when it comes to use on the iPhone or tablet.

## Where do I want this to lead?

No matter what you do in life, work and play, never stop learning. Keep on refining your existing skills and never be afraid to learn new ones. I certainly find this to be the case with both web development and photography, my two parallel careers, so I have already made life complex for myself being something of a polymath. So how best to track what you are learning? Are there any proven methods? More importantly how can you retain all of this new found knowledge more easily when there is so much to take onboard nowadays.

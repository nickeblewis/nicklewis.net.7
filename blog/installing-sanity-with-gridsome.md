I have simply followed the getting started guide on sanity.io website creating a new dataset

```
sanity init
```

```
cd theproject
sanity docs
sanity manage
sanity help
sanity start
```

The latter command runs on localhost:3333 and a quick authenticate later, you are in

```
sanity deploy
sanity graphql deploy
```

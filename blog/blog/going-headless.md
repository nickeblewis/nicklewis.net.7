## The established CMS is no more?

There are many established CMS systems available on the market that cover various levels of needs. Some are virtually free and others costs tens of thousands to operate, so there are options for hobbyists, freelance developers and all the way up tp massive enterprise teams who all have their distinct list of requirements. No matter which one of the aforementioned types of systems you use or have had some exposure to in the past, you can guarantee that their architecture is similar or let's just say they are likely to be database driven. You will also find that they have their own templating system of some kind. The product providing all that you need to manage your content, take control of your templating, design and more.

This systemic design has been the norm for so long. You probably use the most popular of them all, Wordpress. Wordpress now powers a large percentage of the web that we know.

However recently, there has been something of a paradigm shift from traditional CMS systems to a new kind and it's called "Headless".

Now if you are a regular user of a Wordpress Blog you can be forgiven for asking the question, why? What difference does this make to me? Should I be paying attention to this, does it effect me?

Let's imagine for one moment that you are using Wordpress to run your website and that you go for one of the "off-the-peg" themes, meaning zero coding whatsoever, then - no headless is irrelevant to you.

If you do wrangle with your own theme development and find it to be a painful experience, like I did when I used to use WP all of the time, then - YES, you should read more about it and I can help shed some light on it.

Off the record - My sites are now mostly headless...

Good news is that you can continue using Wordpress because it supports this new technological approach but there are other solutions out there that are designed for headless from the very beginning. The first one of these I shall raise here uses no database at all.

## If you are a Developer read this bit!
- This approach is more technical and typically the domain of people who are comfortable with writing code and have some form of familiarity with version control, repositories, continuous integration and so on. So if this is not something you deal with day to day, skip to next section
- First of all, let's explain Markdown
- Static site built from markdown
- Easy to edit using text editors and code editors
- Maintain and deploy via Github

## If you aren't a developer read this bit!
- The previous section was very technical but if you aren't then

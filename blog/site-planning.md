This page is going to work differently to the others in that it can and will bubble back to the top from time to time.

## coSchedule, Buffer or others
I currently mostly use Buffer for scheduling posts

## SM Platforms
- twitter
  - multiple accounts
- fb
  - multiple pages
- insta
  - multi
- linkedin
- pinterest

## Post frequency
- start with weekly posts that go out on Saturday mornings
  - posts are re-sent periodically after this
    - 1 week later
    - 2 weeks later
    - 3
    - 4
    - added to evergreen

## Post timing

## Writing posts with SM in mind

## Write posts that engage people

## Evergreen

## Topics

## Hashtag days

## coSchedule my archive material
- photos and blog
  - set many to being evergreen

## Review requeued items
- there are potentially 245 ones that could be made evergreen

## Matching photos and blog templates up
- same grid
- cover photos to be shown where exist
- using the new component in markdown feature add 
  - youtube
  - photo galleries

## List my tags
- the tags are used to generate tag pages
- links to these tag pages should be added to the homepage under little card style divs
- the tags are as follows
  - code

  - hampshire, surrey, england
  - gardens, plants, flowers, wisley
  - Journal

  - Content
- dont' want tooooo many tags just generalist ones
- tags could help define when certain posts get promoted on social??
  - Photography challenges could go out on fridays

## photo sales

## different areas on site
- varied templates

## Non date paths
- Some posts will not include a date in their path, such as this page ideally
  - URLs should be permalinks on this site
  - changing the path or name of a post URL will break Disqus

## switch off editorial mode in N CMS
Yes this is causing me some trouble and don't need the complexity either, just use published flag instead

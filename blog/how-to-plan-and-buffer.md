## Platforms

- Website
- Buffer
  - Multiple social accounts
  - some of the above will be closed down so that I can simplify and focus

## Website first strategy
My writing/blogging projects all begin here and end up flowing out into the social media world later in the process and the same can be said for my photos. The basic reason for this being that I don't wish to depend on third-party social media platforms as being the only place my content goes. What if they change beyond all recognition and what if they get shut down? 

I recall reading Dries Buytaert's (the founder of Drupal) blog about this subject and that the best place is your own.

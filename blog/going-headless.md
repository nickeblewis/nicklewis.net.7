## The established CMS is no more?

- [ ] may swap this section for the one just after as that makes more sense
  
There are many established CMS systems available on the market that cover various levels of needs. Some are virtually free and others costs tens of thousands to operate, so there are options for hobbyists, freelance developers and going up the scale to enterprise teams who all have their distinct list of requirements. No matter which one of the aforementioned types of systems you use or have had some exposure to in the past, you can guarantee that their architecture is similar or let's just say they are likely to be database driven. You will also find that they have their own templating system of some kind. The product providing all that you need to manage your content, take control of your templating, design and more.

This systemic design has been the norm for so long. You probably use the most popular of them all, Wordpress. Wordpress now powers a large percentage of the web that we know.

However recently, there has been something of a paradigm shift from traditional CMS systems to a new kind and it's called "Headless".

Now if you are a regular user of a Wordpress Blog you can be forgiven for asking the question, why? What difference does this make to me? Should I be paying attention to this, does it effect me?

Let's imagine for one moment that you are using Wordpress to run your website and that you go for one of the "off-the-peg" themes, meaning zero coding whatsoever, then - no headless is irrelevant to you.

If you do wrangle with your own theme development and find it to be a painful experience, like I did when I used to use WP all of the time, then - YES, you should read more about it and I can help shed some light on it.

Off the record - My sites are now mostly headless...

Good news is that you can continue using Wordpress because it supports this new technological approach but there are other solutions out there that are designed for headless from the very beginning. The first one of these I shall raise here uses no database at all.

## What is Headless? 
CMS systems such as Wordpress and Drupal are all encompassing, you can get up and running with them quickly because they cater for all levels of user. If you aren't technical nor a developer then you can use wordpress.com to create and maintain your site. It helps you through the setup steps and I suspect a number of you may have gone through this process if you are a blogger. So at this level it is perfect for the individual who just wants to pick a theme from the options available and gradually configure their site. There is a learning curve but it's one that isn't overly technical.

You may on the other hand be someone who has some technical know-how or maybe you are a web developer, if so, you may opt to go via wordpress.org and host your site yourself. So you would grab a copy of the latest Wordpress "codebase" and install it on a server of choice. Having done that you could still simply install a ready made theme and crack on with it. Some people will go the full hog and write custom code to build a truly bespoke website experience.

No matter which of the above categories you might fit into, behind the scenes you site will be running on a Linux server with PHP for your code and MySQL for your database. Your Themes are all required to be written in a certain format, meaning that if you are developing them, you need to understand PHP and the way in which Wordpress prescribes a theme template to be developed. It is this part of the site that we call the "Head" which is a little bit odd because as web developers we have never really used that term until now.

I for one was never a huge fan of Wordpress templating, the code has to be written in a very untidy looking format and the overall approach is a bit, old hat. Turns out I wasn't the only one to feel that way because some clever folks out there invented this thing called "Headless".

In short Headless allows you to continue using the Wordpress back-office which is excellent and you carry on using it's powerful database but you no longer need to build your sites with the clunky templating engine! You can develop the front-end entirely in JavaScript which has in recent years become the industry standard and thus recruiting developers is a lot easier because they all know JavaScript! 

Wordpress has jumped on the bandwagon with JavaScript too, as you can retrieve data from your CMS system using an API. API stands for Application Programmer's Interface and allows different systems to communicate with eachother. A good example is connecting your site to Instagram to display your social media posts within a sidebar on your website, that makes use of an API to pull in the data and to then transform it into page content at the other end.

I am still a little uncertain about how I market this technology to clients of mine who need to be able to login and edit their content because at the end of the day Headless is more about keeping the Developer happy and not so much the client. However if you can offer them Wordpress as the back-end or maybe another alternative (many are available) then you needn't really mention it to them. Instead you could talk about the benefits it offers, such as performance, security, to name a couple.

## If you are a Developer read this bit!
- This approach is more technical and typically the domain of people who are comfortable with writing code and have some form of familiarity with version control, repositories, continuous integration and so on. So if this is not something you deal with day to day, skip to next section
- First of all, let's explain Markdown
- Static site built from markdown
- Easy to edit using text editors and code editors
- Maintain and deploy via Github

## If you aren't a developer read this bit!
- The previous section was very technical but if you aren't then how does Headless benefit you?

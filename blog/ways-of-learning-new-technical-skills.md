  I just wanted to write a small piece about how I learn new skills and some of
  the things I am digging into now. I explain why Notion.so is so great and why
  Visual Studio Code absolutely rocks.

We live in an age where things move at a higher pace than ever before, the rate of change is on a meteoric rise, these are both exciting and bewildering times. I think we are on the brink of some incredible things, perhaps more of our sci-fi dreams will become a reality quicker than in the past. If like me you class yourself as a _technologist_, you need a firm grip on your direction, it is easy to be distracted, dangerous to procrastinate for too long without the fear of missing out, FOMO they call it. It is bizarre that we now have invented a whole gamut of new fears, all borne from our modern technologically advanced world.

If you know of any new fears, feel free to post them in the comments below, will be interesting to learn more about these things.

Talking of learning, how best to stay on top of what you are learning now and what you need to pin down to your list of things to plough through when time permits? What tools should you use to help you and are there any techniques to help you stay on top of what is worth learning now, later or just gradually without burning out doing so.

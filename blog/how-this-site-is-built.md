## Introduction

The old nicklewis.net website was moved to nicklewis.online a little while ago, so that I can retire it to a certain degree and instead develop the site using more modern JavaScript tools. Earlier this year I started building a new site using VueJS and Gridsome, that at it's core is based heavily on markdown files for it's content. More recently I added Sanity.io to the mix. I now use both Netlify CMS and Sanity.io to manage certain areas of this site because I wanted to experiment with both. However I have hit some problems that I need to resolve, which may lead to me dropping one of the above systems. One key reason being cost, I want to keep the running of this site as cheap as I can. My website has therefore become something of a guinea pig and I hope to learn valuable lessons from this to pass on to you and future clients.

## Introduction
The old nicklewis.net website was moved to nicklewis.online a little while ago, so that I can retire it to a certain degree and instead develop the site using more modern JavaScript tools.
## JamStack
## JavaScript
## VueJS
## Gridsome
## MarkDown
## CMS
## Developers and people who edit the site

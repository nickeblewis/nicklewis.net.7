## Introduction

The old nicklewis.net website was moved to nicklewis.online a little while ago, so that I can retire it to a certain degree and instead develop the site using more modern JavaScript tools. Earlier this year I started building a new site using VueJS and Gridsome, that at it's core is based heavily on markdown files for it's content. 

More recently I added Sanity.io to the mix. I now use both Netlify CMS and Sanity.io to manage certain key areas of this site because I wanted to experiment with both. However I have hit some problems that I need to resolve, which may lead to me dropping one of the above systems. One key reason being cost, I want to keep the running of this site as cheap as I can. My website has therefore become something of a guinea pig and I hope to learn valuable lessons from this to pass on to you and ensure I choose the right tools for future clients.

The Developer and the User

This particular website only has one user and developer which is me but let's imagine for a minute there were more people involved? I needed to take this into account because this website also acts as a prototype for future projects where there will be other people involved, who would need to be able to edit, add content, upload media and so on, so forth. So it is for that reason I've developed it as if I were building it for a client. This helps me architect my processes and workflow.

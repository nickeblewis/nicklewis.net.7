Two weeks ago I purchased the new iPad Pro 11 inch which is one of the first to come bundled with the new iPadOS operating system. I am excited to see how this OS evolves, as I suspect it will introduce many more iPad only features in due course whilst maintaining some form of symbiosis with iOS. It may mean that in time the iPad will share many of the same features as MacOS and that is already apparent when I paired the tablet with my existing Magic keyboard. I haven't yet purchased a Smart Keyboard (the official accessory) because my existing keyboard works well enough for now. I love the Apple Pencil that I did buy at the same time along with a SD card reader, so that I can import files from my Osmo Pocket, Mavic Pro and Sony A7R3 to the device. More on that later.

## Magic vs Smart Keyboard
You can use either and as in my case it's possible to connect an existing bluetooth keyboard to the iPad Pro. However you will need to charge your keyboard separately or replace the batteries if it's an older model (like mine). The Smart keyboard on the other hand can just be hooked up to the iPad and never needs to be charged or have it's batteries replaced plus is more portable. However the feel of the Smart is perhaps not as nice as the magic when it comes to tapping those keys with your fingers! I will purchase a Smart at some point but for the moment, I am happy to make-do with what I have and could pick up a smart keyboard any time later, especially just before we hop on a plane somewhere.

## USB-C and card readers
The offical USB-C dongle for importing files from SD cards works a treat but please bear in mind that it only works in one direction, so you can't transfer files to the SD card from the iPad. I doubt I would ever want to do that anyway, as it is intended to pull files onto the device and then sync everything added to the iCloud. Note that on these new ipads the lightning connector has gone and been replaced with USB-C, something that is gradually happening across many devices now and not just Apple products. The only slightly annoying thing is that this will cause a little disparity for awhile as some of my kit depends on Lightning and new devices as I purchase them will increasingly be adopting the USB-C route. What are your thoughts on this? Good, bad or indifferent?

## The Clouds
I have for a very long time now been the holder of an iCloud account, Google Cloud and Dropbox account, more recently I've added Adobe Cloud to this collection. I am now questioning this, quite a lot in fact. The cost for each isn't extortionate but do you really need multiple cloud accounts? How many more will I end up accumulating over time? I shall no doubt return to this as a subject here on the blog. I'd love to know what you've got and what your thoughts are on having multiple clouds?!

## Apple Photos and Lightroom
Let's start with the Photos app or as some may still call it, the "Camera Roll". I am starting to find it more useful and at times good enough for most things image related. Now that I am pulling in images from the SD reader and alongside this I do use my phone a lot for taking photos too, so you do end up with a large library of photos and videos from a variety of sources. What's more is that all of this is being backed up in the background to iCloud. However Lightroom is still the better app when it comes to editing, though it's fair to say that Photos has improved a lot and sometimes I am more than happy with an edit I've made with it. Currently I have adobe Cloud as well as iCloud and my worry is that I am ending up with duplication, when just one may be enough. I am not going to make any radical changes yet, I am sure that I will figure it out. Maybe someone out there has been facing the same conundrum?

## Using the iPad for editing and blogging
I have been using the iPad Pro for editing photos and video recently using the following set of apps and tools:

- Lumafusion
- Photos app
- Safari
- Lightroom

Recently I have used Lightroom less and Photos more, purely as an experiment to work on images taken from multiple sources, so some may have been taken on my iPhone and others on the Sony A7R3. I wanted to see how I get on with it and to simplify my workflow massively. So far so good. I mark images that are fit for publishing with a favourite love heart and that way I know they've been pushed out there onto the web. 

I then use the split screen feature in ipadOS to drag and drop files into whichever web tool I am using, so this could be Buffer for my social media management or my CMS for this website which can be either Netlify CMS or Sanity.io. Something along those lines.

LumaFusion has pretty much replaced Final Cut on the MacBook for me but wow that's a story for another day, as it is so cool and warrants an article of it's own...

## Shall I sell my MacBook?
Hold on, not so fast! I am very happy with the ipad pro and there is a lot you can do with it that is close to using a dedicated MacOS system but there are certain things you can't do with it. Not yet at least or not in the same way.

The biggest drawback for me right now is that there isn't an equivalent iPad app to Visual Studio Code for JavaScript work etc. There may be a half-way house solution and I'd love to know if there is?

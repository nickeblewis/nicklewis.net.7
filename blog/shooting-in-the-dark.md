The nights are drawing in, so you put your camera away for the winter don’t you? Well no you don’t! You wrap up in scarves, hats, gloves, mittens, thermal socks, thermal... let’s stop right there and grab the camera, I am off for a local walk, just from my front door and I am going to challenge myself to coming home with at least one or two photos I’m pleased with.

That is the key you see, in order to get better and better at something, just do it, throw away those books, stop watching YouTube, buy no more e-books and just follow me instead - just kidding, well apart from that last bit of course. I hope to bring you some really cool tips on how to improve your photography. Now I am no photography guru (some say I am and that is very kind, oh stop it!) but we all learn new stuff every time we go and do the thing we enjoy. Photography especially.

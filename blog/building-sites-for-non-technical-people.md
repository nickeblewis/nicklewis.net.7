  Quite a lot of the posts I write are technical but I am always wary of the
  fact that not everyone understands the terminology used and there are times
  when as a very technical person, you have to adapt your way of expressing or
  developing ideas with those who just need something that works!

My Dad is very patient when it comes to technology, yet when explaining something regarding the web or anything associated with it, I have to talk in a different way compared with how I would discuss similar topics with a colleague. The reason I mention Dad is because recently I created a website for the Jazz Club that he is the Treasurer of and I wanted to ensure that it was clean, as in the un-cluttered sense of the word but at some point to have a set of tools to allow them to carry out basic updates.

The reason I am writing about this here, is so that I can share with you my processes that enable clients to achieve what they need with the minimum of fuss and to keep the tools provided simple...not to mention of course, bullet proof or without sounding condescending, idiot proof!

Now as a Developer of websites, I have used a variety of tools over the years that range from complex enterprise tools like Drupal or even Wordpress but I've often found that some clients don't love them all that much because they have so many options which in the eyes of many, can be confusing. To be honest I've never been a big fan of their development tools either or setting the darned things up and that is why in part I create and deliver sites using the methods that I do. I am a big fan of simplicity and minimalism, perhaps that is why I prefer Apple products over other choices.

I also worry deeply about the security of the above two systems. I have had first hand experience of many Wordpress websites being hacked and no sooner than they are fixed, boom, it happens again.

So I no longer use them... that is the short version of my explanation, the details are complex, hard to describe unless you are genuinely interested, which I suspect you aren't, as you want something that just works don't you?! Just like my Dad.

## How do you want your site to look (roughly speaking)?

Most sites start with a a theme or a template of some kind and I can share some ideas with you here to give you a very good idea of how this rolls. It will always be determined by things such as:

* The purpose of your website
* The intended audience
* Any sites you like the look of that may have given you some inspiration already
* What building blocks can we offer you - i.e Online shop, blog, gallery, portfolio, contact page, social media links, the story of your business or organisattion. The list goes on and on really and the sky is the limit.
* What goals do you have for the site? Is it to reach as many people as possible? To raise awareness?

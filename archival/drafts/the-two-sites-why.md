I run two websites nicklewis.photo and nicklewis.net, let me explain the differences between the two from both a strategic and technical point of view.

The challenge today is to know which set of tools are the best choice for your website, be it your own or a client's. There are many different factors to consider and a bewildering set of options to choose from. A single blog post will only ever scratch the surface, I could probably write books on the topic!

That is where my role is important and has it's challenges too. The purpose of this website is to document my exploration of these options, to showcase them, to educate not just you guys but myself too! The aim being to make the right decisions when people come to me looking for a solution and to commit to it because it's always costly and difficult to change tack in the future. A lot of my choices are governed by web security, speed, performance, development tools and offering a certain degree of control to the client. Common pitfalls are aplenty and I try to learn from them, to reduce the friction of travel in future projects and iterations of those that are well underway.

Anyway before getting too entrenched in detail, lets explain the two sites. Why can't I just have one?!

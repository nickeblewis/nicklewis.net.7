NOTE: I had started to edit this under Sanity.io 

Prior to the Write52 challenge (add link to write52 website here) my blog had lost it's focus a little bit and my previous two weekly posts received some good responses from other Write52ers which is great, thanks to you all for being so kind. I am going to continue along this path that I've started for the remainder of the 52 week challenge. I will mix up the forms of media a little and I will comment more on the technology that I use where I think it is useful to do so but otherwise I want to share my passion for time and place as much as the images that distill those moments for all eternity. 

I the previous post (link to it here) I shared a single photo and wrote about the experience as I remembered it. I often prefer to ponder over which images leave a lasting impression on me for it is more about indelible memories which stick with us. They form the stories that we tell of those times we travelled.

This week though I am going to share with you a video....


## behind the scenes

In true "Blue Planet" style, I have written another article about some of the tools I use for my photography, video work and so on...

Tutorials, workshops

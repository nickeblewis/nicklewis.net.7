# Write52-5 - think of a headline for it

Changing the format of my Write52 posts for a bit, just an experiment to write about a few topics in a newsletter style way, given the fact we quite like our newsletters don’t we? There is that fantastic [award winning pink one](https://write52.com) of course, plus there are many on platforms such as SubStack, Revue etc... more on those hopefully in a later blog post of mine because they are rather compelling though I am still reluctant about them, preferring to take my own approach to this as opposed to signing up to yet another bundle of services and they aren't as clear cut as they might seem.

Never mind that, what is new on this website...

## Sunday morning walks

The clocks had gone back so it was a good morning to get out early as the sun rose. It is important to find places that are quick to get to in your locality and to go for a bracing cold walk, nothing stirs the senses more. It brings the blood to your cheeks. Breakfast when you return with a hot brew to return the heat to your hands, is the best kind of thing at this time of year.

### Basingstoke Canal

Around our neck of the woods, literally, there are some great woodland walks! So I headed for Wellesley Woods that straddles part of the Basingstoke Canal between Farnborough and Aldershot in Hampshire. The woods are well mapped out with new clearly marked out pathways and I believe there are maps that you can download via QR codes on the information panels in the car parks. In any case I know it well enough to find my way around and I followed one particular circuit with my camera at the ready.

(Pick out a few images)

Reflections on the water at this time of the year are often the best and the reason for this is the angle of the light, as you know when you are out driving the sun gets in your eyes more, well it helps produce better light for photography at least! Calm frosty mornings also help accentuate the effect because that stillness makes a huge difference, especially when it comes to incorporating water in your photography.

Mist above the water is always a treat, especially where the light catches it and creates a backlit effect. You can never predict where mist will occur exactly and I often (should write an article on this as a subject of it's own) find that just planning on going somewhere, following a route on foot with some vantage points in mind is the best way to plan photography outings, the rest is just down to good old serendipity. Just take your chances, those magic moments are always a delight and stir your soul.

Autumn colours are coming fast, falling off the trees even faster this year. I doubt you'll see that many decent autumn images out of me this time round. I think the heavy rain and winds we've had these past couple of weeks will have contributed to this, however there are pockets of vibrant colour here and there, just not all that easy to find. I could do with visiting an aboretum.

## iPhone 11 on order

After moving away from Android around 2014 I have been an iPhone owner for quite some time, I got tired of the bloatware on my Samsung phones and since I had owned an iPod from the moment they were launched, I was more than tempted to give the Apple phones a try. So from the iPhone 5 (I think) I entered the iPhone world and with each new device (except the 7 for some reason) being launched I tend to upgrade when my contract is due to upgrade. This weekend however, for the first time ever I paid an extra £400 to upgrade to the Pro Max 9 months early because the camera system is worth having! Now all I have to do is wait patiently for around the next 3 weeks... has it been dispatched yet? Is it nearly here yet?

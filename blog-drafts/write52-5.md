Write52-5 - think of a headline for it

Changing the format of my Write52 posts for a bit, just an experiment to write about a few topics in a newsletter style way, given the fact we quite like our newsletters don’t we? There is that fantastic [award winning pink one](https://write52.com) of course, plus there are many on platforms such as SubStack, Revue etc... more on those hopefully in a later blog post of mine because they are rather compelling though I am still reluctant about them, preferring to take my own approach to this as opposed to signing up to yet another bundle of services and they aren't as clear cut as they might seem.

Never mind that, what is new on this website...

- Sunday morning walks
  - The clocks had gone back so it was a good morning to get out early as the sun rose. It is important to find places that are quick to get to in your locality and to go for a bracing cold walk, nothing stirs the senses more. It brings the blood to your cheeks. Breakfast when you return with a hot brew to return the heat to your hands, is the best kind of thing at this time of year.
  - Basingstoke Canal
    - Around our neck of the woods, literally, there are some great woodland walks! So I headed for Wellesley Woods that straddles part of the Basingstoke Canal between Farnborough and Aldershot in Hampshire. The woods are well mapped out with new clearly marked out pathways and I believe there are maps that you can download via QR codes on the information panels in the car parks. In any case I know it well enough to find my way around and I followed one particular circuit with my camera ready.

Write52-5 - think of a headline for it

Changing the format of my Write52 posts for a bit, just an experiment to write about a few topics in a newsletter style way, given the fact we quite like our newsletters don’t we? There is that fantastic award winning pink one of course, plus there are many on platforms such as SubStack, Revue etc... more on those not this time round but hopefully in a later blog post of mine because they are rather compelling...

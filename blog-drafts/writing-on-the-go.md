I love many writing apps but by the far the easiest for me has to be IA Writer, since it handles markdown files like a dream. If you arenâ€™t familiar with what Markdown is, then take a look at this (page). I can write using MD (markdown) on my iPad Pro, sync my work to iCloud and to GitHub fairly easily.

Some readers may be thinking this sounds over-engineered when you can just use Wordpress and be done with it and to be fair that is a good question, so I shall try to explain what this all means in this article and some follow ups.

- IA Writer (iOS)
- Working Copy (iOS)
- GitHub
- Netlify
- Gridsome
- Image management

Do you keep a bullet journal at all? Some of you may already do this and I wanted to extol the virtues of doing so, as it can keep your mind sane and perhaps just that bit more focused - I struggle with focus at times and it has helped me. How do you start? Do you need apps? Do you need a special kind of notebook? A special kind of pen?

You donâ€™t need anything in particular, just a little bit of a system that you can stick to.

What lives in this folder is a map of my work, my brain (if you like) because as a developer you need to stay on top of so much at once. If you stumble upon this little page whilst surfing the web, please drop a note in the comments below - What interests you right now in technology and/or photography? 

Currently I am reasearching ways of getting more out of Netlify, Headless CMS systems, AI Bots and more! I shall be writing up notes here and transforming them into full articles as they develop into complete enough documents. I could do a write up on this for those interested, to share my writing process which is an ongoing thing.

This area is going to be broken down into the following sections and the reason for this is that I wish to present these sections in different ways. I will elaborate on this in due course.

* blog
* drafts
* explore
* ideas
  * All of my raw ideas are thrown in here where they are gradually refined
  * Once they mature move them to one of the public sections
* lab - my experiments
* learn
  * The best way of learning is to teach others and you all learn together. So this section will be dedicated to a range of short courses that I am developing over the next year before release. 
  * Special template for this section to resemble popular online course websites
* other
* photography
  * Though I do have my other site nicklewis.photo, I want to develop some templates to sit within this site
  * My photography generally stems around the exploration of locations, so this section could be divided up accordingly
  * However the blog tends to be a better place for these
  * So maybe this section could be more for the technical notes around photography?
* (photography-old) -> merge this with the above
* services
* solutions
* todo.md

All of the above sections and their pages are wired up to Disqus, so that we encourage engagement with the readers out there.

There is a possibility that if the content grows in certain areas more than expected, that new websites could be formed.

## Stepping away from Wordpress and others

## Adopting a modern CMS

## Follow a real world example

## The back story

I am telling this story in a way that tries not to be too technical because this article is aimed at current and future clients. However it revolves around Wordpress and the reasons you may either want to change the way you use the product or step away from it entirely.

First of all let me give you a good reason for wanting to do this in the first place and some of the actual challenges that you could face. I will start with the toughest transition first and that is - to start again, using a whole new approach to delivering your website and it's content.

Now suppose you've been a Wordpress user for many years but have had a spate of hacks where phishing scripts have been injected into your site? The first port of call here is security, how good is it or not? What makes some systems more secure than others and how can they be exploited so easily?

Systems Architecture has remained much the same for decades with the majority of sites running some form of Linux, PHP and a MySQL database (LAMP) which is what Wordpress runs on.

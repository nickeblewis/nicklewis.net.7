I have discovered how Markdown in conjunction with the fabulous Visual Studio Code is helping me structure my thoughts in ways that traditional todo apps and note taking apps don't achieve. That said though Bear, IA Writer and Ulysses are all really good and can be exported as Markdown. So I feel that these tools are all very closely aligned.

This document started life as "Todo" though I am now doubting this title, for it is a file where I dump my initial business ideas, thoughts, even tasks and from this I _incubate_ things from the tiny seeds of ideas into fully fledged projects, whether it is code or photography.

# Goals
- [ ] Develop income streams in addition to contracts

# Tasks

- [ ] what is vue fuse
- [ ] sign up for netlify analytics
- [ ] Tidy up this document and make it more useful and even shareable! I could scan through the content folder and map out what needs doing to complete the ideas I have come up with and a better structure for the folders that we can stick with more reliably. permalinks matter for SEO purposes
- [ ] /screencasts/how i edit this site - write the transcript and record the video :-)
- [ ] check up on my search console, looking like its ramping up and do some test searches on Google, review the clicks and what the keywords were for them

Hmmm - just drilled down to the clicks for this and it may be referring to my old site? However I could translate some of the old content from Wordpress to markdown, such as the red kites article? 

- [ ] maybe delete properties in search console for nicklewis.net and start again

- [ ] Disqus would be great too

- [ ] softwarebyrob.com

- [ ] move my mugshot to the top, should be opener

- [ ] continue content development, find ways of managing it better, though doing it all through VS Code like this seems to be a beautiful way :-)

- [ ] Update Gridsome from 0.6.4 to latest and what changes does that bring update current blog journal
- [ ] I want to make my home page more of a personal tone, like Kent C dodds and to appeal as a mentor and teacher as much as a faceless business
- [ ] Slack channel HeadForCode
- [ ] Add something to any of my "incomplete" content pages that are there as placeholders to allow people to make contributions to them or to be updated when they are actually published?
- [x] google sitemap  
- [x] google analytics - isn't this one done?
- [x] content requires it's own template but base it on blog to start with
- [x] change the tags for this article and get content covered by tags in the build
- [x] get the contact form working on Netlify
- [x] as soon as poss map my domain to this
- [ ] Snipcart purchase button underneath each image ;-) see if I can work out a way...
- [ ] blog content themes
- [ ] Stock photography diary
- [ ] https://snipcart.com/vue-ecommerce


- [ ] Tree shaking what is it?


- [ ] scss in vue
- [ ] tailwind Gridsome grids for photos
- [ ] vue-bootstrap, fabric, toast editor and wot-not

- [ ] nativescript vue sounds intriguing
- [ ] CV
- [ ] Github -projects to use
- [ ] JSFiddle, Codepen and what are the other great alternatives out there. Plus what we use on this site for code documentation
- [ ] Modify the readme for this project to reflect what I am doing with nicklewis.net
- [ ] change the graphics on my homepage to be more personal to me
- [ ] Patreon -for what?
- [ ] github sponsorship (what?)
  - [ ] develop gridsome/gatsby plugins perhaps for which I could seek sponsorship?
- [ ] https://gridsome.org/plugins/gridsome-plugin-netlify-cms 
  - [ ] Install for this site and see how it goes
- [ ] SEO tags for these pages
  - [ ] Noted that nicklewis.photo searches for aldershot festival yield nothing, so need to master how this works

# Applications I am planning to build

## HeadForCode

* I am going to base this on the copy of form builder that I have
* Will work out how I plan to use it, even if it is just for structural guidance and nothing else
* I plan to build a platform that could be used for other tutorial sites besides HeadForCode
* The application will allow you to build courses and publish them online to subscribing customers

### Databases, API and back-end?

I am thinking along the lines of something that outputs GraphQL

## Tina's site 

* Not yet named but it could use the same tool that HeadForCode uses as described above??

# Nicklewis.net

So what we have right now is this lovely website....
- [ ] Chatbot I started with FB Messenger and Dialogflow -> carry on with it, what other options are there?

## Screencasts

- [ ] Short screencasts to show off stuff I think is great in the devtools I use, starting with VS Code and it's new breadcrumbs feature and how it works so well with markdown documents like this one - then tweet both the website link here and the actual video directly
- [ ] I review some of my favourite website UIs and I have just created a new page here that goes into further plans for this idea, as I want to shortlist the sites that inspire me and how I would go about creating similar UI features using Vue. See [Screencasts Todo list](/screencasts/todo)

# External Links
## startups for the rest of us: ep. 452
mentions:
- bootstrapped web - is that a podcast?
- clickcart
- interviewee is interesting, keeps 12 month cash up front
### ep. 453
- Ambassador?

## new stuff discovered

- Vue draggable which we use at clearbox https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable/issues/324

## to find out

- npm list

# Form builder notes

I want to take away some stuff with me, I know I have until October but there is so much to glean from this project that I want to capture some notes of my own. A lot of this should probably go on a page of it's own but for now, I am dumping things on this markdown page.

* Details: (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/generate-service-worker/webpack)

### API MOCK
* In the development environment is used the JSON-Server, an REST APIs emulator
* Because of the way the API was built, a number of settings were required for the emulator to behave exactly like the API
* The file [src/mock_api/server.js] control the API emulator, and the file [src/mock_api/db.json] contains all api mock data
* [JSON-Server] project and documentation: (https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
* JSON-Server uses [db.low] to manage its database in JSON. 
  * If be necessary to interact directly with JSON, more information can be found at: (https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)

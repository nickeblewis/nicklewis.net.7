## The IoT DevKit AZ3166

https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/

- [ ] write intro, why I am interested and some ideas I could pursue or explore in the future

### Getting started

- [ ] Setup the AZ3166 for the first time, does it work with the Surface and the Mac? I had two issues, one on each OS that I've yet to resolve, will document here
- [ ] Run through the sample projects at https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/projects/ firstly the "Getting Started"
- [ ] Decide which ones to try after that
- [ ] What to experiment with next? Well the sky is the limit, as doing a search on Google for "azure devkit sample projects" proves, here are some I found that I will dig into and explore.

## Optimising sites for search

__Be descriptive__ 

Titles should state the intention of the page and focus as much as they possibly can on one subject. If you have multiple topics to write about, break them down into separate pages and link them together instead.

__Be complete__

Cover all of your bases in each page, so verbose writing is more likely to be found than text which is a little vague on the chosen subject.

__Be Topical__

Take into account the change of seasons, trends or new offerings. So make sure content you want to be found in the Autumn, such as a photography workshop in the Cairngorms that features Autumn Colour is more prominent. So maybe you'd like it to be listed towards the top of your homepage for better visibility.

__Keep it fresh__

Ensure time sensitive content is deleted if it is no longer relevant, such as events passed. Keep the current and forthcoming events as high as you can on any list you maintain.

__Text is best__

Remember that text is always best for the content you want indexed. Images, animations and downloadable files are very unlikely to be scanned, unless the clever clogs at Google have ways of doing so!

__Get referrals__

Speak nicely to other website owners to persuade them to link to your site but make sure there is some kind of relevance across the board.

## Measure your performance

__Impressions__

How many times your site has been seen by someone searching on Google

__Clicks__

How many times someone has clicked a search result link to your site

__Average Position__

The average position of your site in search results with number 1 being the top spot

  I have recently started looking at alternatives to Lightroom because sometimes
  it is worth having a look at such things and being open to new ideas,
  especially when they employ modern AI technology, now that had me very
  interested indeed

I have been a Lightroom user for many years and can remember the days when I was using it's predecessor but cannot remember the name of the product other than that Adobe acquired the software house that produced it. Anyway what I haven't been so sure about is the fact that I have to pay a monthly subscription. Yes, I know that it gives me cloud backup and synchronisation across devices. I do miss the days of simply buying a software product and the ability to upgrade for a smaller fee every now and again. So when I heard of Luminar I had to take a look.

The above picture of the Glasshouse at RHS Wisley has had some AI enhnacements applied to it which is an area of software development that deeply fascinates me. Well delighted to see that it does a great kob with saturation and enhancing the drama we see in those clouds, nice job on the contrasts yet it maintains the relative normality and balance of the other elements of the photograph. 

Below is a screengrab of the software's UI and shows how I quickly enhanced this image with a single slider. I could have further enhanced the photo but chose to leave it at that. Just the one filter!

Will it replace Lightroom for me? I have yet to form an overall opinion on this and that will take time. Naturally I will write more about my discoveries and adventures with this different application! So join me for the journey :-)

  My round-up of photography for the week
---

Tim (my Brother) who is a film-maker has been digging into his archives and I am inclined to spend time doing the same, you cannot beat doing this, especially when (dare I say it), the weather turns, the nights draw in and you can fill your room with the glow from your screen of beautiful images of past adventures.

If you don't fancy going too far, then you are bound to find somewhere that is on your doorstep to explore, as Tim often does and at the same time encourages his daughter (my niece) to learn more about the world around her. Devices are of course all the rage but not the be all and end all in life. We must all escape outdoors from time to time whether it is urban or rural.

Meanwhile much further away in San Diego I always enjoy reading the tales of photographer Alex Kunz who emigrated from Europe to the US some years ago. He loves nothing more in fact to escape into the wilderness with his camera and to maintain a nature diary. He is well worth a follow for his blog is incredibly consistent (my god I need to take a leaf from his book but hey-ho)
